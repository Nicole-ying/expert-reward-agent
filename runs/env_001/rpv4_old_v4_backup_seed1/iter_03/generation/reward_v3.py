    Reward function for 2D rigid-body lander with two support legs.
    Designed for goal_approach_and_soft_contact: reach center pad,
    land softly with near-zero velocities, upright, and both legs in contact.

    Key change (iter 3): contact_bonus now velocity-gated via
    exp(-3.0 * speed_sq). Only low-velocity contacts receive the full bonus;
    high-speed touchdowns are strongly penalized by near-zero bonus.
    This forces the agent to decelerate before ground contact rather than
    relying on the sparse bonus to mask hard landings.
