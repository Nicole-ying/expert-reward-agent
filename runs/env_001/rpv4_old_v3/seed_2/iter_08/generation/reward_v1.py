    Reward function for lunar lander style 2D flyer landing.
    Main goal: reach target platform (x≈0, y≈0) with low velocity, upright.
    Components:
        A: progress (distance reduction towards target)  -- main learning signal
        B: velocity damping (next_obs squared velocity)  -- stability constraint
        C: orientation stabilization (next_obs angle/angular velocity) -- stability constraint
        D: fuel penalty (per action cost)                -- efficiency / mild action cost
    Weights chosen so that A dominates, B/C soft‑constrain, D is light.
